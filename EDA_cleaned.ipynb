On the other hand it also suggests that men are more likely to die because of other causes.\n",

    "- **<5 years**: `Toddlers` - While cancer is rare in this age group, when it can occur. Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes.\n",
    "- **5-14 years**: `Kids` - Childhood cancers, though uncommon, include leukemias, brain cancers.\n",
    "- **15-19 years**: `Teenagers` - This age group sees an increase in cases of thyroid cancer. \n",
    "- **20-29 years**: `Young Adults` - The risk of breast cancer, ovarian, cervical cancer, stomach and thyroid cancer becomes more pronounced, especially in individuals with certain genetic predispositions or lifestyle factors.\n",
    "- **30-44 years**: `Adults` - Cancer risks increase and diversify, including colon, kidney, breast, pancreatic, and lung cancers. \n",
    "- **45-59 years**: `Adults` - This group sees a higher incidence of cancer, making screenings for colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers increasingly important for early diagnosis and treatment.\n",
    "- **60-64 years**: `Adults` - Cancer risk continues to rise, with a significant focus on screening for cancers that have higher survival rates when detected early, such as colorectal, lung, and bladder cancer.\n",
    "- **65-69 years** and **70-74 years**: `Adults` - As individuals age, the prevalence of cancers such as prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer increases. \n",
    "- **75+ years**: `Seniors` - The highest risk of cancer is observed in this age group. \n"

    "The graph presents the total number of deaths from cancer diseases from 1990 to 2019, broken down by various age groups. The age group \"70+ years\" consistently has the highest number of deaths, followed by \"60-69 years\" and \"50-59 years,\" suggesting a higher cancer incidence with increasing age. The trend for these groups is relatively stable. The younger age groups (\"<5 years\" through \"25-49 years\") show significantly fewer deaths, with the lowest numbers in the \"<5 years\" category. The data underscores the importance of age as a risk factor in both cancer incidence."
